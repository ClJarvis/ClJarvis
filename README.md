### Hi there, I'm Chris Jarvis

I'm a software developer, puzzle solver, and a Full Stack storyteller,  A love of creative endeavors & solving puzzles led me to delve into software development.  My calm, organized demeanor and my tenacious determination in solving problems will be a unique asset to a development team.

 Here's a recent project I made to help elementry school students practice logging into an onlie application. Once they have logged in thay can get a inspiational quote about the important of reading. I made a flask version then remade it with vanilla javaScript.
